#You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.

def duplicateNumber(arr, n) :
    count = 1
    for i in range(0, n):
        if arr.count(arr[i]) > count:
            duplicate = arr[i]   
    return duplicate

n = int(input())
arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
arr = duplicateNumber(arr, n)
print(arr)
