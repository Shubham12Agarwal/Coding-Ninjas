#You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

import sys
def intersections(arr1, n, arr2, m) :
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
                print(arr1[i], end=" ")
                arr2[j] = sys.maxsize
                break
    return arr1, arr2

n = int(input())
m = int(input())
arr1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
arr2 = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
