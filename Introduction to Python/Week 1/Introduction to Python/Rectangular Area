#You are given a rectangle in a plane whose sides are parallel to the axes. The coordinates of one of its diagonals are provided to you. You have to print the total area of the rectangle.
#The coordinates of the rectangle are provided as four integral values: x1, y1, x2, y2. It is given that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

# Read the coordinates of the diagonal from input
x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())

# Calculate the length and width
length = abs(x2 - x1)
width = abs(y2 - y1)

# Calculate the total area
total_area = length * width

# Print the total area
print(total_area)
